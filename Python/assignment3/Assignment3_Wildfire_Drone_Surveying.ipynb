        "## Description\n",
        "Imagine you are working for wildfire prevention and management. You have access to a fleet of eight drones to monitor the forest. You want to optimize your operations according to some constraints. You are limited by both the drone technology and the requirements of the surveying. \n",
        "\n",
        "You are given the following information:\n",
        "1. The list of drones\n",
        "2. The periods of surveying, divided in weeks\n",
        "  * Example: MayWeek1, MayWeek2…\n",
        "3. The number of drones needed for each week\n",
        "4. The maintenance schedule for each drone – maintenance makes the drone unavailable for that week\n",
        "\n",
        "## Requirements\n",
        "### Technological\n",
        "The drones require a periodical maintenance. The maintenance team has a fixed schedule, defined a priori and given to you as an input. While on maintenance, the drone cannot be used. Because the drones use a lithium battery, you would like to balance how much each drone is used. For example, instead of drone A being used continuously and drone B being used only a few times, you would prefer to use drone A and drone B the same amount of times as to reduce the cost of replacing batteries.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Natural\n",
        "For surveying purposes, each month of the year has a different requirement of drones – the riskier the month, the more drones you need to survey the forest properly. \n",
